Trigger:
- Solving 2-3 modules while active

Behavior:
- When activating, the timer will sit at 88 (IDLE)
- When triggered, a random module is disabled and the timer is set to [30*(1+(#ofModules / 6))] and will now start counting down
- Navigate to the correct panel and reset the correct fuse to reset the needy back to its IDLE state

Parts:
- The box door can be opened and closed manually, as it could block the view of other modules
 > While closed, you cannot interact with the fuses
- The fuse panel inside holds up to 6 fuses, 3 per row
 > Empty spots, boss modules, needies, and the timer will not have a fuse in their spot
- The 2 arrows on either side will scroll the fuse panels. The display in the top left shows what page is displayed
